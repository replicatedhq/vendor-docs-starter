# Welcome

This repository contains a sample documentation site for software vendors that distribute their application with [Replicated KOTS](https://docs.replicated.com). Vendors can use this template site to write documentation for their end users that describes how to install and manage their application.

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
