## Configure [App Name]

This section includes procedures for configuring [App Name].

### Configure [Section 1]

To configure [Section 1]:

1. For **[Field Name]**, enter [information].

1. (Optional) For **[Field Name]**, enter [information].
  <!-- Put (Optional) at the start to denote optional fields.-->

### Configure [Section 2]

To configure [Section 2]:

1. For **[Field Name]**, enter [information].

1. For **[Subsection Name]**, complete the following fields:
<!-- To handle subsections with multiple fields,
use the following table format-->
   <table>
     <tr>
       <th>Field Name</th>
       <th>Description</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>[Field Name]</td>
       <td>Enter [information].</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>(Optional) [Field Name]</td>
       <td>Enter [information].</td>
     </tr>
   </table>

### (Optional) Configure [Section 3] <!-- Put (Optional) at the start to denote optional sections.-->

   * **[Option A]**: To [do x], select **[Option A]**.
   * **[Option B]**: To [do x], select **[Option B]**.
   <!-- Use this bulleted list format if the user needs to
   select between multiple options.-->

When you complete the fields on the configuration screen, click **Continue** to proceed to the next step.

## Pass Preflight Checks and Deploy

<!-- Review the content in this section and make any edits for your use cases as needed. -->

After you save the configuration for [App Name], you can run the preflight checks and deploy.

Preflight checks are conformance tests that the admin console automatically runs to ensure the cluster meets minimum requirements. Preflight checks provide clear feedback about any missing requirements or incompatibilities in the cluster before you deploy.

To complete the preflight checks and deploy [App Name]:

1. If there are no preflight check warnings or failures, continue with deployment.
2. If there are any preflight check warnings and failures:
    * Resolve the warnings and failures, and click **Re-run** to run the preflight checks again.
    * If there are no failures that prevent application deployment, you can choose to dismiss the preflight check warnings to continue.

      We recommend that you address any warnings or failures, rather than dismissing them. Preflight checks help ensure that your environment meets the requirements for application deployment.

    * If you are installing with minimal role-based access control (RBAC), the admin console recognizes if the preflight checks failed due to insufficient privileges.

      When this occurs, a kubectl preflight command displays that lets you manually run the preflight checks. The results are then automatically uploaded to the admin console.

  After preflight checks are complete, the application is deployed, and the admin console dashboard opens.
